        <div class="poem-layer echo-4">i have this productivity anxiety
that everyone else is working harder than me
and i’m going to be left behind
cause i’m not working fast enough or long enough
and i’m wasting my time

i don’t sit down to have breakfast
i take it to go
i call my mother when i’m free
otherwise it takes too long to have a conversation

i put off everything that
won’t bring me closer to my dreams
as if the things i’m putting off
are not the dream themselves

isn’t the dream
that i have a mother to call
and a table to eat breakfast at

instead i’m lost in the sick need to 
optimise every hour of my day
so i’m improving in some way
making money in some way
advancing my career in some way
because that’s what it takes to be successful right 

i excavate my life
package it up
sell it to the world
and when they ask me for more
i dig through bones
trying to write poems

capitalism got inside my head
and made me think my only value
is how much i produce
for people to consume

capitalism got inside my head and made me think
i’m of worth as long as i am working

i learned impatience from it
i learned self-doubt from it 
i learned to plant seeds in the ground and
expect flowers to grow the next day

but magic
doesn’t work like that
magic doesn’t happen
cause i’ve figured out how to pack more work in a day
magic moves by the laws of nature 
and nature has its own clock
magic happens when we play
when we escape
when we daydream and imagine
now that’s where everything with the power to
actually fulfill us is waiting on its knees for us</div>
