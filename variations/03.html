        i have this <span class="work">productivity anxiety</span>
        that everyone else is <span class="work">working harder</span> than me
        and i’m going to be <span class="work">left behind</span>
        cause i’m not <span class="work">working fast enough</span> or long enough
        and i’m <span class="work">wasting my time</span>
        
        i don’t sit down to have <span class="human">breakfast</span>
        i take it <span class="work">to go</span>
        i call my <span class="human">mother</span> when i’m <span class="work">free</span>
        otherwise it takes too long to have a <span class="human">conversation</span>
        
        i put off everything that 
        won’t bring me <span class="work">closer to my dreams</span>
        as if the things i’m putting off
        are not the <span class="human">dream themselves</span>

        isn’t the <span class="human">dream</span>
        that i have a <span class="human">mother to call</span>
        and a <span class="human">table to eat breakfast at</span>

        instead i’m lost in the <span class="work">sick need to optimise</span> 
        <span class="work">every hour of my day</span>
        so i’m <span class="work">improving</span> in some way
        <span class="work">making money</span> in some way
        <span class="work">advancing my career</span> in some way
        because that’s what it takes to be <span class="work">successful</span> right 

        i <span class="work">excavate my life</span>
        <span class="work">package it up</span>
        <span class="work">sell it to the world</span>
        and when they <span class="work">ask me for more</span>
        i <span class="work">dig through bones</span>
        trying to <span class="work">write poems</span>

        <span class="work">capitalism</span> got inside my head
        and made me think my <span class="work">only value</span>
        is <span class="work">how much i produce</span>
        for people to <span class="work">consume</span>

        <span class="work">capitalism</span> got inside my head and made me think
        i’m of <span class="work">worth</span> as long as i am <span class="work">working</span>

        i learned <span class="work">impatience</span> from it
        i learned <span class="work">self-doubt</span> from it 
        i learned to <span class="work">plant seeds</span> in the ground and
        expect <span class="work">flowers to grow</span> the next day

        but <span class="human">magic</span>
        doesn’t <span class="work">work</span> like that
        <span class="human">magic</span> doesn’t happen
        cause i’ve figured out how to <span class="work">pack more work in a day</span>
        <span class="human">magic moves by the laws of nature</span> 
        and <span class="human">nature has its own clock</span>
        <span class="human">magic happens when we play</span>
        <span class="human">when we escape</span>
        <span class="human">when we daydream and imagine</span>
        now that’s where everything with the <span class="human">power to</span>
        <span class="human">actually fulfill us is waiting on its knees for us</span>
