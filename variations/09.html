        <div class="stanza">i have this productivity anxiety
        that everyone else is working harder than me
        and i’m going to be left behind
        cause i’m not working fast enough or long enough
        and i’m wasting my time</div>

        <div class="stanza">i don’t sit down to have breakfast
        i take it to go
        i call my mother when i’m free
        otherwise it takes too long to have a conversation</div>

        <div class="stanza">i put off everything that
        won’t bring me closer to my dreams
        as if the things i’m putting off
        are not the dream themselves</div>

        <div class="stanza">isn’t the dream
        that i have a mother to call
        and a table to eat breakfast at</div>

        <div class="stanza">instead i’m lost in the sick need to 
        optimise every hour of my day
        so i’m improving in some way
        making money in some way
        advancing my career in some way
        because that’s what it takes to be successful right</div>

        <div class="stanza">i excavate my life
        package it up
        sell it to the world
        and when they ask me for more
        i dig through bones
        trying to write poems</div>

        <div class="stanza">capitalism got inside my head
        and made me think my only value
        is how much i produce
        for people to consume</div>

        <div class="stanza">capitalism got inside my head and made me think
        i’m of worth as long as i am working</div>

        <div class="stanza">i learned impatience from it
        i learned self-doubt from it 
        i learned to plant seeds in the ground and
        expect flowers to grow the next day</div>

        <div class="stanza">but magic
        doesn’t work like that
        magic doesn’t happen
        cause i’ve figured out how to pack more work in a day
        magic moves by the laws of nature 
        and nature has its own clock
        magic happens when we play
        when we escape
        when we daydream and imagine
        now that’s where everything with the power to
        actually fulfill us is waiting on its knees for us</div>
